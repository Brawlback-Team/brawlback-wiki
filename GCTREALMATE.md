# GCTRM Documentation

## Introduction
Brawl codes modding is traditionally an arduous process that involves writing ASM, converting it to hexadecimal Gecko codes, and finally creating a \*.GCT file from this. However, in recent years there has been progress made that speeds this process up; first, we had software and websites to convert the ASM to Gecko codes, but now we have a program called GCTRealMate aka GCTRM that automates the workflow from start to finish, as well as adding some quality of life functionality to writing codes. While there does not exist any official documentation from its creator DukeItOut, P+ utilizes GCTRM and has some good examples of what is possible within its source code, as well as introducing its workflow. Let's review some basic needs and how to satisfy them, as well as introduce some new concepts.


## Gecko Codes
**Example**
#################
Infinite Replays
#################
\* 040E5DE8 60000000
\* 04953184 60000000
\* 04953224 60000000

**Explanation**
To write pure Gecko codes for GCTRM to process, you simply write the code and add an asterisk and a space before every line of hexadecimal pairs.
