# GCTRM Documentation

## Introduction
Brawl codes modding is traditionally an arduous process that involves writing ASM, converting it to hexadecimal Gecko codes, and finally creating a \*.GCT file from this. However, in recent years there has been progress made that speeds this process up; first, we had software and websites to convert the ASM to Gecko codes, but now we have a program called GCTRealMate that automates the workflow from start to finish as well as adding some quality of life functionality to writing codes.
