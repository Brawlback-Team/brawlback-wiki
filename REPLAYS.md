# Replays Documentation

## Introduction
With the introduction of Slippi to the Melee scene, the bar for the quality of replays has risen. While true that Brawl has existing "replays", these "replays" are just a collection of inputs, RNG values, and game settings locked behind a file that is encrypted and compressed using algorithms unknown to anyone, meaning you can't do anything particularly interesting with them. The goal of the replays portion of this project is to open up the replay format for Brawl to make them more Slippi-like; files that have compression/encryption methods known to developers and users alike so that they can utilize these files in other ways, most notably the launcher to contain more replays at once.
